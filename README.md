# au-pair
It is a very simple application prototype developed in python with no GUI for care-takers and care-seekers (primarily aged people).

Just run the main.py and go with the flow.
It has a two-way login system. You can either login as a care-taker or a care-seeker with login-id [1-4] to test it. 
Updation in data file are not supported yet as this is a very minimal version.
